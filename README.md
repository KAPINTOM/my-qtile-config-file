# My Personal Qtile Configuration Repository üñ•Ô∏è

Welcome to my **personal Qtile configuration repository**! This repository contains my custom configuration files for the **Qtile** window manager, tailored to my workflow, preferences, and aesthetic tastes. Qtile is a highly customizable tiling window manager for Linux, and this configuration reflects my personal setup, optimized for productivity, performance, and visual appeal.

## What's Inside? üìÇ

The repository contains two main files, located in the `~/.config/qtile/` directory:

### 1. **`autostart.sh`** üöÄ
   - **Description**: This is a Bash script that runs automatically when Qtile starts. It initializes essential services and applications to ensure a smooth desktop experience.
   - **Technical Details**:
     - **Picom**: Starts the Picom compositor for window transparency, shadows, and other visual effects.
     - **Nitrogen**: Restores the desktop wallpaper using Nitrogen, a lightweight wallpaper manager.
     - **Network Manager Applet**: Launches `nm-applet`, a system tray applet for managing network connections.
     - **Volume Icon**: Kills any existing `volumeicon` processes and restarts it to manage audio volume via a system tray icon.
     - **Auto-mount**: Automatically mounts a specific drive (`/dev/sdb1`) using `udisksctl`.

   #!/bin/bash

   picom &  # Start Picom compositor
   nitrogen --restore &  # Restore wallpaper
   nm-applet &  # Launch network manager applet
   pkill -f volumeicon  # Kill existing volumeicon processes
   sleep 1  # Wait for 1 second
   volumeicon &  # Start volumeicon for audio control
   sudo udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb1 &  # Auto-mount a specific drive

### 2. **`config.py`** üõ†Ô∏è
   - **Description**: This is the main configuration file for Qtile, written in Python. It defines keybindings, layouts, widgets, and other settings to customize the window manager.
   - **Technical Details**:
     - **Keybindings**: Custom keybindings for window management, application launching, and system controls (e.g., brightness, volume).
     - **Layouts**: Multiple tiling layouts, including `Columns`, `Max`, and `Matrix`, with customizable borders and margins.
     - **Widgets**: A status bar with widgets for system monitoring (CPU, memory, network), a clock, and a system tray.
     - **Autostart**: Integrates with `autostart.sh` to launch essential services on startup.
     - **Custom Commands**: Includes commands for launching applications like `rofi` for application and window management.

   # Keybindings for window management
   keys = [
       Key([mod], "left", lazy.layout.left(), desc="Move focus to left"),
       Key([mod], "right", lazy.layout.right(), desc="Move focus to right"),
       Key([mod], "down", lazy.layout.down(), desc="Move focus down"),
       Key([mod], "up", lazy.layout.up(), desc="Move focus up"),
       Key([mod], "e", lazy.spawn("rofi -i -show drun -modi drun -show-icons"), desc="Launch rofi"),
       Key([], "XF86MonBrightnessUp", lazy.spawn("brightnessctl set 10%+"), desc="Increase brightness"),
       Key([], "XF86AudioRaiseVolume", lazy.spawn("amixer -D 'default' sset Master 10%+"), desc="Increase volume"),
   ]

   # Layouts with custom borders and margins
   layouts = [
       layout.Columns(border_focus=["#ff0000"], border_normal=["#000000"], border_width=5, margin=5),
       layout.Max(border_focus=["#ff0000"], border_width=5, margin=5),
       layout.Matrix(border_focus=["#ff0000"], border_normal=["#000000"], border_width=5, margin=5),
   ]

   # Widgets for the status bar
   screens = [
       Screen(
           bottom=bar.Bar(
               [
                   widget.CurrentLayout(),
                   widget.GroupBox(highlight_method="line"),
                   widget.WindowName(background="#191919"),
                   widget.Net(format="{down:.0f}{down_suffix} ‚Üì‚Üë {up:.0f}{up_suffix}", background="#002980"),
                   widget.CPU(update_interval=2, background="#802900"),
                   widget.Memory(format='{MemPercent: .0f}', update_interval=2, background="#008033"),
                   widget.Clock(format="%d/%m/%y %H:%M", timezone="America/Bogota"),
                   widget.Systray(background="#2a0033"),
                   widget.QuickExit(),
               ],
               24,
           ),
       ),
   ]
